## Admin Workflow: Creating Quizzes, Questions, and Answers

1. Create Categories: The admin creates categories first (e.g., "Math," "Science").
2. Create Quizzes: The admin creates quizzes under specific categories.
3. Create Questions: The admin creates questions for each quiz. Each question can be of different types (e.g., multiple-choice, true-false).
4. Create Answers: The admin defines the correct answers for each question. These answers are saved as part of the question in the database.

## User Workflow: Taking a Quiz

1. Attempt the Quiz: A user attempts the quiz and selects answers for each question.
2. Submit the Quiz: After submitting the quiz, the system compares the user's answers with the correct answers stored in the database.
3. View Results: The user sees their score, and can view the correct answers along with explanations.
